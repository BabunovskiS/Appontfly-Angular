          Behavior flow in Google Analytics identifies pages, volume of traffic, and paths of traffic, such as the most
          common routes visitors take to get in and out of specific pages. You can get a great view of the overall flow
          of traffic surrounding a specific page, customer journey, or funnel. When you compare the behavior flow
          against the time spent on your site, you can quickly identify pages that are bridges and areas of the site,
          which are conversion hubs.
